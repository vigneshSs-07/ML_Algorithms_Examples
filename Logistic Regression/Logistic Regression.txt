Logistic Regression :

---> Logistic regression is about predicting binary variables i.e when the target variable is categorical.
---> The aim of logistic regression is to predict some unknown probability P for a successful event, for any given linear combination of independent variables (features).
---> the output is natural logarithm of the odds , also known as logit. The base of the logarithm is not important but taking logarithm of odds is.

odds : 
-> Higher the odds, better is the chance for success. Range of odds can be any number between [0 , ∞]. 

Odds ratio :
-> is the ratio of odds. 
-> odds ratio can vary between 0 to positive infinity, log (odds ratio) will vary between [-∞, ∞]. 
   Specifically when odds ratio lies between [0,1], log (odds ratio) is negative.


-> Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution with two possible outcomes labelled by n=0 and n=1, in which n=1 (successful event) occurs with probability P and failure i.e.
   n=0 occurs with a probability 1-P. 
-> The dependent variable in logistic regression follows Bernoulli distribution having an unknown probability P. Therefore, the logit i.e. log of odds, links the independent variables 
   (Xs) to the Bernoulli distribution.
