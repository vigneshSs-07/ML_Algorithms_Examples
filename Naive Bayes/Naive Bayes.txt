Naive bayes is a probabilistic algorithm. Calculate probability of each class for every observation.

Types 

1. Gaussian NB :
	-> when variables are continuous
	-> Assumes a normal distrubtion
2. Multinomail NB :
	-> features represnt frequency
	-> ignores non occurence of features
	-> text classification problems
3. Bernoulli NB :
	-> features are binary
	-> penalize non occurence of features.
