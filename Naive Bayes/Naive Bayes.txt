Naive bayes is a probabilistic algorithm. Calculate probability of each class for every observation.

Types 

1. Gaussian NB :
	-> when variables are continuous
	-> Assumes a normal distrubtion
2. Multinomail NB :
	-> features represnt frequency
	-> ignores non occurence of features
	-> text classification problems
3. Bernoulli NB :
	-> features are binary
	-> penalize non occurence of features.

P(A|B) − It is also called the posterior probability i.e. the probability of first event i.e. A to occur given that second event i.e. B occurred.

P(B|A) − It is the probability of second event i.e. B to occur after first event i.e. A occurred.

P(A), P(B) − It is also called prior probability i.e. the probability of first event i.e. A or second event i.e. B to occur.
